# Simplified Guide to RWAP (Real World Asset Protocol)

## What is RWAP?
RWAP stands for "Real World Asset Protocol". It's a new way to represent real-world financial assets (like government bonds) in the digital world. Think of RWAP as a bridge connecting traditional finance with digital finance.

### The First Project of RWAP
RWAP's first big project involves creating digital tokens backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. These tokens are kind of like digital IOUs, backed by real government promises to pay. This project is a partnership between AE Trust and a guy named Chris Hughes.

### The Plan
AE Trust and Chris Hughes are teaming up for RWAP. They're also planning to merge AE Trust into RWAP. Think of it like a partnership where one company eventually becomes part of the other.

### How It Works
1. **Accounts and Compliance**: AE Trust will handle all the nitty-gritty details of setting up accounts and making sure everything complies with legal stuff.
2. **Two-Token System**: RWAP uses two types of tokens:
   - **STTB (Short-Term T-Bills Token)**: This token is like a digital version of a short-term government bond.
   - **DBILL (Debt Bill Token)**: This represents the stable value of the STTB token.

### The Process
- **Buying Tokens**: Anyone can buy DBILL tokens. But to convert DBILLs into STTBs or to cash out, you have to go through some identity checks (KYC).
- **Legal Stuff**: Just like other companies (Paxos, Gemini) that do similar things, RWAP operates under established laws for these types of financial activities.

### The Difference
- **Yield and Flexibility**: Unlike other stablecoins (like USDT, USDC), RWAP lets investors earn yield and increase the supply of these asset-backed tokens. They can be used in various financial activities, like lending in the crypto world.

### Target Audience
RWAP is mainly aiming at institutional investors who want to earn more than the usual market rate by mixing traditional government bond yields with crypto lending.

### The Future
After succeeding with STTB, RWAP plans to explore more such projects, like working with international trust companies on tokenized investments in the U.S. money market.

**In essence, RWAP is blending traditional finance with the digital realm, offering a unique approach to how we interact with and benefit from financial assets in the crypto space.**
